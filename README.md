## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript (regEx)

### Useful resources

- [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - A modern, HTML5-ready alternative to CSS resets
  Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.

### What I learned

Working with a simple and effective code, as it's possible?
